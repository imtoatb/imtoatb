## 🎓 About Me

I am currently in my **first year of the engineering cycle (I1)** at EFREI, after completing the Integrated International Prep Program.

My training combines **computer science, mathematics, and data analysis**, and I am particularly interested in roles involving:
- data exploration and analysis,
- model development and evaluation,
- software and data-oriented problem-solving.

I am looking for an **alternance in a private-sector company**, preferably in a **hybrid setup around South Paris (Cachan - 94 and nearby areas)**.
